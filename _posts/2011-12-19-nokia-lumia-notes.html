I've been given a Lumia by Nokia for testing. Here's a bunch of loose notes I'm keeping as I use it:

<ul>
<li>Straight out the box it's a very nice device. The hardware is solid. Seems a bit bigger than my 4S, though.</li>
<li>There are no open ports on the device, had some trouble opening the two slots/flaps on the top (one for USB and one for the SIM tray).</li>
<li>Quite impressed with Windows Phone 7 -- I've never used it before. Very playful. There's iOS-standard smooth scrolling!</li>
<li>Installed twttr and foursquare. The foursquare app is particularly slick.</li>
<li>The XBOX Live app works on the Lumia. Couldn't get it to work on iOS.</li>
<li>Tried to view a PDF somebody had emailed to me but I was forwarded to the download page for the Adobe Acrobat app. No thanks!</li>
<li>Does Windows Phone not have companion software? iPhone has iTunes, for example.</li>
<li>I like how the screen rounds off into the case, it's comfortable. Somewhat organic? Like a pebble?</li>
</ul>
