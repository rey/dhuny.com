<p>This morning I was emailed a gem of a PRO TIP by <a href="http://twitter.com/bon">John Blackbourn</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>So you know Google adds those F_CKING ANNOYING instant previews and +1 buttons to search results? whack these rules into your <a href="http://adblockplus.org/">ad blocker</a> and they'll disappear:</p>

<p>Thanks, John!</p>
