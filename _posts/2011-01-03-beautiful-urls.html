<a href="http://jimray.tumblr.com/post/2584553426/designing-good-urls">Jim Ray links</a> to a good post by <a href="http://warpspire.com/posts/url-design/">Kyle Neath about URL design</a> (emphasis mine):

<blockquote><p><b>Any regular semi-technical user of your site should be able to navigate 90% of your app based off memory of the URL structure</b>. In order to achieve this, your URLs will need to be pragmatic. Almost like they were a math equation â€” many simple rules combined in a strategic fashion to get to the page they want.</p></blockquote>

A thousand times yes.

I'm reminded of <a href="http://simonwillison.net/notes/2006/summit/coates.txt">Simon Willison's notes on a talk Tom Coates gave in 2006</a> which are still massively valid (emphasis mine):

<blockquote>
<p>Good URLs should:</p>
<ul>
<li>be permanent references to resources</li>
<li>have a 1-to-1 correlation with concepts</li>
<li>use directories to represent hierarchy (e.g. subordinate parts)</li>
<li>NOT reflect the underlying technology - especially if it might change</li>
<li>reflect the structure of the data</li>
<li>be predictable/guessable/hackable</li>
<li>be as human readable as possible</li>
</ul>

<p>[...]</p>

<p><b>Good URLs are beautiful and a mark of design quality</b></p></blockquote>

Bonus: a page's <a href="http://dhuny.com/post/97#title-tags">&lt;title&gt;</a> should be <i>a reply</i> to it's URL :)

<b>EDIT</b>: Here is a link to the PDF of Coates' slides from Future of Web Apps '06: <a href="http://www.plasticbag.org/files/native/native_to_a_web_of_data.pdf">Native to a Web of Data</a>.
