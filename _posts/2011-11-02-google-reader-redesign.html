<blockquote><p>And so I put my resources where my mouth is. As the former lead designer for Google Reader, I offer my services to Google, rejoining for a three month contract in order to restore and enhance the utility of Google Reader, while keeping it in line with Googleâ€™s new visual standards requirements. I will put my current projects on hold to ensure that Google Reader keeps its place as the premier news reader, and raises the bar of what a social newsreader can be.</p></blockquote>

<p>I really hope the GOOG take him up on this. The Google Reader redesign is terrible :(</p>
