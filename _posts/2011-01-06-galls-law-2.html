<a href="http://twitter.com/Darrenux/status/22961139839148032">Darren pointed to Gall's law today</a>:

<blockquote><p><strong>A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked</strong>. The inverse proposition also appears to be true: A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be made to work. You have to start over, beginning with a working simple system.</p></blockquote>
