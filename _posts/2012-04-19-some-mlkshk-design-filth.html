<p>It's no secret that I adore <a href="http://mlkshk.com">MLKSHK</a> &mdash; it's one of the things that excites me on the interwho at the moment.</p>

<p>Here is one example of awesome.</p>

<p><img src="http://rey.textdriven.com/archive/dhuny.com/uploads/2012/04/Screen-Shot-2012-04-19-at-10.27.13-2.png" alt="MLKSHK drag to upload" title="MLKSHK drag to upload" width="662" height="271" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-538" /></p>

<p>This is the handy New Post panel that appears when you click the er, <em>New Post</em> button. Naturally, you can click <em>Upload an image</em> to bring up a file browser window where you can select an image to upload.</p>

<p>However, you can also drag an image to that panel and it'll upload! It's a small, hidden cheeky bit of functionality but such is the design of MLKSHK, you already know it's going to work before you do it.</p>

<p>Intuitive is defined as "<em>Using or based on what one feels to be true even without conscious reasoning</em>". MLKSHK has fun, intuitive design in bucket loads.</p>

<p><small>Few websites/apps that I use these days have any sort of personality, which I find sad.</small></p>
