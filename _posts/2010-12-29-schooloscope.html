Lovely website of the day is <a href="http://www.schooloscope.com">Schooloscope</a> which is a website that:

<blockquote><p>Take[s] official Government-backed information about state schools in England and try to tease out something interesting from the dry tables of statistics.</p></blockquote>

The design is splendid and the graphics are are glorious, <a href="http://schooloscope.com/primary/108378">here is my primary school</a>. Crafted by <a href="http://berglondon.com">BERG</a>.
