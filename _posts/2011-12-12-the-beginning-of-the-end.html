<blockquote><p>What also worries me is that these changes suggest not only a difference in opinion regarding how a Twitter client should work, but also regarding just what the point is of Twitter as a service. The Twitter service I signed up for is one where people tweet 140-character posts, you follow those people whose tweets you tend to enjoy, and that’s it. The Twitter service this new UI presents is about a whole lot more — mass-market spoonfed “trending topics” and sponsored content. It’s trying to make Twitter work for people who don’t see the appeal of what Twitter was supposed to be. It all makes sense if you think of the label under the “#” tab as reading “Dickbar” instead of “Discover”.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is worth reading. I particularly agreed with the above paragraph. Gone are the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dominic/188848143/">days of simplicity</a>. It seems that there's a push to "make money" which isn't a bad thing at all but when it comes at the expense of user experience and/or common sense you're doing something wrong.</p>
