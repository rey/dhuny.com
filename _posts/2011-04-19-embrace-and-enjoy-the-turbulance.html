<blockquote><p>When things become chaotic, unpredictable, and overwhelming, the best thing you can do is embrace and enjoy the turbulent ride. The more you worry, the worse the situation gets. What you focus on increases. Once you flip off the worry switch, things become easier to deal with and even enjoyable.</p>

<p>You canâ€™t always control the winds and the turbulence - the only choice you have is to freak out or enjoy it.</p></blockquote>
