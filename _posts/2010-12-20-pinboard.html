Many moons ago I decided to look for an alternative to <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> after Yahoo! launched it's redesign of the service. It was atrocious: ugly, bloated and the complete opposite of why I began using the bookmarking service in the first place. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/reyhan/2724116332/">I knew it was doomed in August 2008</a>.

I began using <a href="http://pinboard.in">Pinboard</a> on July 4 2009 and it was exactly what I wanted del.icio.us to be (or remain).

Undesign is what I'm about and Pinboard has it in bucket loads. You should <a href="http://pinboard.in/signup/">sign up</a> &mdash; it's worth every penny.
