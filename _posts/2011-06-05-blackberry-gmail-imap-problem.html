So last week I got an email from BlackBerry that said:

<blockquote><p>Your yournamehere@gmail.com email messages are not being delivered to your BlackBerry® device. To receive your email messages, turn on the IMAP setting for All Mail in your yournamehere@gmail.com account.</p>

<p>After you turn on the IMAP setting for All Mail, you must validate your account on your BlackBerry device.</p>

<ol>
<li>Click the Setup folder (if available), then click the Email Settings or Setup Internet Email* icon.</li>
<li>Click Email Accounts.</li>
<li>Validate your yournamehere@gmail.com email account.</li>
</ol>

<p>The other email accounts on your BlackBerry device are not affected.</p>

<p>BlackBerry® Internet Service</p>

<p>* Note that some BlackBerry devices and some themes may have different icons or menus than those mentioned.</p>

<p>-- Automatically generated email: Do Not Reply to this email --</p>
</blockquote>

In trying to find a solution, the OS forced me to update the Email Accounts application to version <strong>6.11.0419.0755</strong>. You don't want to do this as it'll break your BlackBerry. <a href="http://dhuny.com/post/299">Here's how to update your email accounts whilst avoiding this buggy update</a>.

Anyway, here is how to get your Gmail on your BlackBerry working again:

<ol>
<li>Open your <strong>Gmail Mail settings</strong> and go to <strong>Labels</strong></li>
<li>Make sure the <strong>Show in IMAP</strong> checkboxes are ticked for both <strong>All Mail</strong> and <strong>Drafts</strong></li>
<li>This got my Gmail working again!</li>
</ol>

I found <a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/gmail/thread?tid=21d0dc88a53e4ef8&hl=en">this solution buried in the Gmail support forums</a>.
