I've had this problem with a few machines that I've recently formatted (fresh install of OS X Lion) so I thought I'd jot down the solution for my future sanity.

The problem occurred when trying to install the <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> gem. After updating my RubyGems it was spitting an error. Peruse my Terminal:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/2083162.js?file=jekyll-gem-solution"></script>

To fix, I went into <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12">Xcode</a>, opened Preferences and clicked Downloads and installed the Command Line Tools.

I found the solution after some Googling but I've mislaid the source. Sorry about that.
