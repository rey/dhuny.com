<blockquote><p>I want some measure of control over form elements, without changing them so drastically as to appear foreign in a user’s operating system. Thus, my quest to find a happy medium, where browsers would generally agree and let me keep my sanity. The result is what I’m simply referring to as <a href="http://host.sonspring.com/formalize/">Formalize CSS</a>.</p></blockquote>

This looks useful. It's always been a pain maintaining a continuous look between browsers when it comes to forms. I look forward to using Formalize CSS in future projects. Also? Less headaches :)
