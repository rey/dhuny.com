I was floating around the internets when I found <a href="http://www.iamcal.com/issue-tracking/">Issue Tracking - The Good & The Awful</a> by Cal Henderson, written back in March.

What caught my interest (apart from the fact that <a href="http://hedgehoglab.com/products/fixx/">I helped build an issue tracker</a> many moons ago) was where Henderson talked about <a href="http://github.com">Github</a>'s system of creating new issues (emphasis mine):

<blockquote><p>While it doesn't explicitly tell me that I need to log in to file a bug, <b>it seems pretty obvious</b>. So I go ahead and do that and am presented with the pinnacle of bug reporting forms:</p>

<p><img src="http://dhuny.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/github_create_3.png" alt="github_create_3" title="github_create_3" width="641" height="320" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-122" /></p>

<p><b>A title and description. And a quick search for previous issues. That's it.</b> Just report the bug. I don't need to understand how their development team is organized, how they handle priorities, or what they call individual parts of the software.</p></blockquote>

When building things on the 'tubes I find super simplicity (or <a href="http://dhuny.com/post/tag/undesign">undesign</a>) wins every time because it results in interfaces that <i>are</i> obvious. No complexity or cruft.

I don't think there's anything else I need to say :)
