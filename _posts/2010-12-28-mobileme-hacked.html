On November 27, 2010 my <a href="http://me.com">MobileMe</a> account was hacked. I found this somewhat surprising since my password was strong (nonsensical, upper/lowercase, numbers + characters).

Today I discovered that my MobileMe account had been hacked again.

If you find yourself in my situation, your best bet is going through <a href="https://expresslane.apple.com/GetproductgroupList.do">Apple's Express Lane</a> where I was able to chat with a helpful support person who, after confirming my identity, sent me a link to a page where I could reset my password.

Now this is all very well, however, I'm paying Â£59 a year for an unreliable service.

What's particularly vexing is that the email address in question isn't public and only friends/family know of it so I have no idea how/why my account is being compromised. My MobileMe renewal date is approaching so I guess I'll have to decide whether it's worth paying for if I can't be guaranteed a secure account.

<b>EDIT</b>: I ended up renewing my MobileMe subscription.
