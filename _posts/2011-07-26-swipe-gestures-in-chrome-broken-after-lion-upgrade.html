Last week I downloaded the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">newly released Lion update for OS X</a>.

Unfortunately, the three finger swipe gestures to go forward/back through web pages in <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/">Chrome</a> had stopped working :( Clicking the back button or hitting backspace was driving me nuts so I hit the GOOG and <a href="http://www.google.pl/support/forum/p/Chrome/thread?tid=36701a9aeca0d08c&hl=en">found a fix</a>, courtesy of a Google employee:

<blockquote><p>Three finger swipes still work in Chrome. The issue you're having is that default swipes in Lion are two fingers. Go into System Prefs, then into trackpad and change the swipes from 2 fingers to 3. You can also make it both 2 and 3 finger swipes to accomplish the same thing, in which case swiping will work in Chrome and you'll see get the cool two finger swipes in Safari that have special animations.</p></blockquote>
