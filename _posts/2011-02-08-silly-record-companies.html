<blockquote><p>This is fucked up. I want to pay for music. I value the content. But selling it to some people in some countries and not selling it to others is messed up. And selling it in CD only format is messed up. And posting the entire record on the web for streaming without making the content available for purchase is messed up.</p></blockquote>

I can't understand why record companies release music in one country before another. I want to buy music. Having to wait weeks for a later UK release is ridiculous.
